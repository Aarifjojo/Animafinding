        </ol>

        <!-- Section 3: Leveraging ChatGPT for Learning Programming -->
        <h2>Leveraging ChatGPT for Learning Programming</h2>
        <p>ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is a conversational AI model capable of understanding and generating human-like text. It serves as an interactive assistant, answering coding-related questions, explaining concepts, and even generating code snippets based on prompts.</p>
        <h3>Applications of ChatGPT in Learning to Code:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Concept Clarification:</strong> Provides detailed explanations of programming concepts, making it easier to grasp complex topics.</li>
            <li><strong>Code Generation:</strong> Generates code snippets based on descriptions, aiding in learning new functions or algorithms.</li>
            <li><strong>Debugging Assistance:</strong> Helps identify and fix errors in code by analyzing error messages and suggesting solutions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How to Utilize ChatGPT Effectively:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Access ChatGPT:</strong> Visit the <a href="https://chat.openai.com" target="_blank">OpenAI ChatGPT page</a> and create an account or log in.</li>
            <li><strong>Pose Specific Questions:</strong> Ask clear and specific questions to receive precise answers. For example, "How do I implement a binary search algorithm in Python?"</li>
            <li><strong>Review and Test Responses:</strong> While ChatGPT provides accurate information, always review and test the generated code to ensure it meets your requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Iterative Learning:</strong> Use ChatGPT to explore variations of code snippets, enhancing your understanding through experimentation.</li>
        </ol>

        <!-- Section 4: Combining GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT -->
